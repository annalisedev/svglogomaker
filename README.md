# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and then will automatically save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file. A test has also been created to ensure the request is working.

The application is invoked by using the following command on the Integrated Terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```
A walkthrough video was created to demonstrate it in use.
